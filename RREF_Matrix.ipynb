        "### We'll look at what it means for a matrix to be in Reduced Row Echelon Form (often abbreviated as RREF). This form is very useful in solving systems of linear equations as the solutions to a linear system become a lot more obvious. We will now define what it means for an m×n matrix A to be in this form.\n",
