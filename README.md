## **Reduced Row Echelon Form of a Matrix (RREF)**

#### We'll look at what it means for a matrix to be in Reduced Row Echelon Form (often abbreviated as RREF). This form is very useful in solving systems of linear equations as the solutions to a linear system become a lot more obvious. We will now define what it means for an m×n matrix A to be in this form.

#### **Definition**: Let A be an m×n matrix. Then A is said to be in **Reduced Row Echelon Form** if A satisfies the following four properties,

1. All of the rows that do not consist entirely of zeroes will have their first nonzero entries be **1** which we defined as **leading 1s**.
2. For any two rows that are not entirely comprised of zeroes, the leading 1 in the row below occurs farther to the right than the leading **1** in the higher rows.
3. Any rows consisting entirely of zeroes are placed at the bottom of the matrix.
4. Every column that contains a leading **1** must have zeros everywhere else in that column.
For example, the following matrices A, B, C and D are all in RREF.
